Imprinter, version 1
====================

Imprinter is a PHP-based CMS written for Imprint, the official student newspaper
of the University of Waterloo. It's features include:

- **Usability and Performance Speed:** Features like drag-and-drop image upload and auto-complete on many form fields make tedious tasks faster and easier, and a framworkless architecture means that pages load quickly, even in high traffic
- **Flexible Templating:** Content generation and presentation are seperated with a simple but fexible templating engine that adapts Imprinter to a newspaper's specific needs, and a unique "frontpage" template automatically fills the homepage and section pages with dynamic content.
- **Tagging and Filtering:** Sophisticated filtering lets the most important stories occupy the most important spots on the homepage, while several different types of tags let articles be sorted quickly and effectively.
